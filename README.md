Name: Matthew Gelber

Date: May 7 2021

Course: EGRE 531

Instructor: Dr. Xiao

Assignment: Final project with goal to parallelized merge sort algorithm

To compile this code:  gcc -g gelber_merge_sort_final_project.c -o final -lpthread -lm

The -g flag is optional as I used GDB to debug the code and this flag enables GDB debugging.
